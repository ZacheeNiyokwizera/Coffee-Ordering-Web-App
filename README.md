# Coffee Ordering Web Application Project 🌎

## Description 📝✍

The Coffee Shop Project is a web application that provides a dynamic and interactive way for users to browse, customize, and purchase coffee. It includes predefined coffee types, integration with third-party sources for coffee data, and extensive customization options for users to create their own unique coffee blends.

## Features

## Project Description  🧑‍💻📖

This project is a coffee ordering application that allows users to explore a variety of coffee options, customize their drinks, and place orders. Here are the key features:

- **Coffee Selection**: Users can choose from a predefined list of coffee types (e.g., Latte, Macchiato, Espresso, Americano) and view detailed information about each coffee, including its price, description, and customization options.
  
- **Customization**: The application enables users to customize their coffee orders by adding or modifying ingredients such as milk, sugar, and other extras. This allows users to create a unique coffee experience tailored to their preferences.

- **Order Placement**: Users can add their customized coffee selections to the cart, proceed to checkout, and place their order. 

- **Order History**: After placing an order, users can view their order history. This feature provides a list of past orders, including details such as order ID, items purchased, total cost, and shipping details. This helps users keep track of their previous purchases and re-order their favorite items easily.

## Technologies Used 🤖

### **Frontend:**
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Used to create the interactive and dynamic components of the application.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types, helping with code quality and development efficiency.
- **Bootstrap**: A CSS framework used for styling and responsive design.
- **React Router**: A library for handling routing and navigation within the React application.
- **Jest**: A testing framework used for unit testing React components and application logic.
- **React Testing Library**: A set of utilities for testing React components and their behavior.
- **Babel**: A JavaScript compiler used to convert ES6+ code into backwards-compatible JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with different browsers.

### **Backend:**
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, used for building the server-side logic.
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js, used to create API endpoints and handle HTTP requests.
- **TypeScript**: Used on the server-side for better type safety and development experience.
- **Jest**: Used for testing backend logic and API endpoints.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing and managing coffee data, user information, and order details.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, used to model application data.

### **Development Tools:**
- **Babel**: A JavaScript compiler used to ensure compatibility across different environments by transforming modern JavaScript code.

## Installation 🖥️

Backend:

1. Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/ZacheeNiyokwizera/Coffee-Ordering-Web-Appgit

2. cd into the backend folder: cd backend

3. Install the Node libraries required for development into your environment and run :

```npm install```

4. Create a MongoDb database, copy your MongodB connection url and create a .env file.  Name it .env, and fill it with the necessary credentials.
5. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/add/api/coffee` using [this sample](https://api.myjson.online/v1/records/c33b3149-dabc-452a-94ff-c0110a418043) containing data for 5 coffee entries.


6. Run the application: You should already be familiar with running a Node application using your favourite IDE or directly from a terminal/command prompt using ```npm run dev```

7. Open your browser and navigate to ```http://localhost:5000/api/coffee```.

Frontend:

1. After cloning the repo in step 1 above in the backend section, cd into the root Folder folder and cd frontend

2. Install the dependencies: ```npm install```

3. Run the application: ```npm start```

4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. The Application should be running on localhost port 3000 i.e ```http://localhost:3000/```

## Testing : To run tests, use the following command:

1. **Backend** : After cloning the repository, cd backend, install the required dependencies and run
   ```npm test``` or ```npx jest backend/getCoffeeController.test.ts```

1. **Frontend**: After cloning the repository, install the required dependencies and run
   ```npm test``` or ```npx jest test```

## Testing the main application logic :

I've made sure the core functionality of the application is well-tested. Specifically, I’ve added unit tests for the getCoffee API to ensure it accurately retrieves coffee data. Additionally, I've tested the UI functionalities, including fetching coffees, displaying them, customizing options, and adding items to the cart.

## For a real-life implementation of my coffee-ordering application on AWS :

I’d use several AWS services to ensure everything runs smoothly and scales effectively. First off, **Amazon EC2** would be great for hosting the backend, giving us a reliable environment to handle user requests. I’d also consider **AWS Lambda** for some serverless magic—like processing orders or generating user IDs—so we don’t have to worry about managing servers.

To store coffee images and static files, **Amazon S3** would be perfect, and we could use **Amazon CloudFront** to speed up delivery to users everywhere. For our database, **Amazon RDS** would manage user data and orders with ease, and **AWS DynamoDB** could handle things like session info or user preferences with high performance and low latency.

To keep things secure, **AWS IAM** would control access to all our resources, making sure only the right people and components have the right permissions. For keeping everything running smoothly, **AWS CodePipeline** and **AWS CodeBuild** would automate testing and deployment, so we can push updates quickly. Plus, **Amazon CloudWatch** would help us monitor performance and spot any issues fast.

This setup would make the app scalable, easy to maintain, and ready to grow, all while keeping testing and deployment as smooth as possible.
